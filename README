- Topic: Behavior Detection for Children with ASD from Continuous Videos
- Details:
- Select datasets from reference [1] or [2]. Both of them contain continuous, naturally captured videos of children with ASD.
- Identify state-of-the-art model (conventional deep learning, vision-language models) for activity recognition using video or skeleton data.
- Summarize the model’s performance across different aspects.
- Summarize unique challenges or potential research problems for leveraging continuous video/sensor data for human behavior understanding.
